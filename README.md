## Project Title: Car Evaluation Classification

### Dataset Information:
- **Dataset Name:** Car Evaluation
- **Source:** Donated on 5/31/1997, derived from a simple hierarchical decision model.
- **Characteristics:** Multivariate, Classification task, Categorical features.
- **Instances:** 1728
- **Features:** 6
- **Target Variable:** Class (Evaluation level: unacceptable, acceptable, good, very good)

### Dataset Description:
The Car Evaluation Database is derived from a hierarchical decision model that evaluates cars based on concepts such as buying price, maintenance price, technical characteristics (comfort, number of doors, capacity, luggage boot size, safety), and the overall acceptability of the car. The dataset provides a real-world scenario for testing classification algorithms.

### Objectives:
1. **Data Exploration:** Explore the dataset to understand its structure, identify missing values, and gain insights into the distribution of features.
2. **Data Preprocessing:** Handle any missing values and encode categorical variables.
3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Visualize relationships between different features and the target variable for better understanding.
4. **Model Training:** Implement a classification model to predict car acceptability based on input features.
5. **Model Evaluation:** Evaluate the model's performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
6. **Interpretability:** Interpret the model's decision-making process and understand the key features influencing predictions.

### Python Libraries and Tools:
- **DataSet:** https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/19/car+evaluation
- **Pandas:** For data manipulation and preprocessing.
- **Matplotlib and Seaborn:** For data visualization and EDA.
- **Scikit-learn:** For building and evaluating the classification model.
- **Jupyter Notebooks:** For interactive development and documentation.

### Proposed Workflow:
1. **Data Loading:** Use Pandas to load the Car Evaluation dataset into a DataFrame.
2. **Data Exploration:** Explore the dataset to understand its structure, check for missing values, and visualize feature distributions.
3. **Data Preprocessing:** Handle any missing values and encode categorical variables for model training.
4. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Visualize relationships between features and the target variable.
5. **Model Training:** Utilize Scikit-learn to train a classification model (e.g., Decision Tree, Random Forest, or SVM).
6. **Model Evaluation:** Evaluate the model's performance using appropriate metrics.
7. **Interpretability:** Understand the model's decision boundaries and feature importance.

### Expected Deliverables:
1. **Jupyter Notebooks:** Include notebooks for data exploration, preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.
2. **Visualizations:** Present visualizations for EDA and model performance.
3. **Model:** Trained classification model with documentation.

This proposal outlines the key steps, tools, and objectives for the Car Evaluation Classification project. The team will collaborate to achieve the project goals and deliver a well-documented solution.
